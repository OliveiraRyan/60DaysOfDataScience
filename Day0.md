# Understand Data Science Interviews

## <u>**Interview Process**</u>
5 Steps:

1. Application (<2 Weeks)
2. Recruiter Screening (1-2 Weeks)
   * **20-30 mins**
   * **Topics Discussed**
     * Details about open role
     * Candidate background (elevator pitch)
   * **Technical screening with basics SQL questions**
     * Only large companies really do this 
   * **Prep tips**
     * Practice explaining your career narrative
       * At a high level, what you have done
       * Sell your story
     * Project a positive and friendly impression
       * Come across friendly!
       * The recruiter is your ally
       * Brush up on SQL basics
       * Gather as much info about interviews as possible
         * Try to get as much info as you can from the recruiter
3. Technical Phone Call (1-2 Weeks)
   * **~45 mins**
     * 40 mins of problems
     * 5 mins of questions for interviewers
   * **Problem Sets**
     * SQL (15-20 mins) on text editor (non executable)
       * Table JOINS, DISTINCTS, WINDOW functions, WHERE clause, CASE clause
     * Product-Sense (15-20 mins)
       * open-ended questions involving a combination of metrics, analytics, and AB testing
   * **Prep tips**
     * Practice mock interviewing
     * Practice solving SQL problems
     * Cultivate product-sense by using the product (if applicable)
4. Onsite Rounds (1-2 Weeks)
   * **Normally around 4-5 rounds**
     * **SQL**
       * 2-3 medium to hard problems
       * **Evaluation**: Completion, solution efficiency, and communication
     * **Applied Data**
       * 1 open-ended question and 3-5 follow-ups
         * Open-Ended business case problem
       * **Evaluation**: Completion, statistical soundness, product-sense, and communication
     * **Quantitative**
       * 2-3 statistical and probability teasers
       * **Evaluation:** Completion, accuracy, statistical-sense, and communication
     * **Product-Sense**
       * 2-3 open-ended questions with follow-ups
       * **Evaluation:** Completion, statistical-sense, product-sense, and communication
       * Can be broken down into 3 types of problems:
          1. Product analytics
             * Requires you to investigate something
          2. Metrics
             * Involves measurement 
          3. AB Testing
             * How would you design an experiment 
5. Hiring Committee (1-2 Weeks)

Total time of Interview Process: **4-8 weeks**


## <u>**Sample Questions**</u>
Context: Facebook

### **Technical Phone Example Questions:**
* Difference between unions and unions all
* Difference between left join, inner join, full outer join

### **On-site example questions:**
* SQL:
  * "Given a table of user profile data and post metadata, what percent of users post within a month of their birthdays?"
  * "Given a table with user id and post id, calculate a 30-day moving median of the post count per user on each date."
* Applied Data:
  * "How do you know if two friends are best friends?"
  * "How do you detect fake posts?"
* Quantitative (concepts to know):
  * Bayes Theorem
  * Conditional Probability
  * Hypothesis Testing
  * P-Value
  * Confidence Interval
  * Basic Distributions (i.e. Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal)
* Product-Sense
  * Product Analysis
    * "A success metric increased in country A, but decreased in country B. Why?"
  * Metric-Sense
    * "How would you measure success on Instagram Stories?"
  * AB Testing
    * How would you design experimentation that tests whether a new algorithm on News Feed improves engagement among users?"
